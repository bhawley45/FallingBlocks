# FallingBlocks
 My first Unity project from 2020. I lost the source code for this project when I switched computers, but managed to find a build in one of my cloud drives. This was one of my first experiences with game development from my college time. 

 ### Important Note on Windows SmartScreen Warning

When you download and run this application, Windows may display a SmartScreen warning because the software is unsigned. This is a common warning for applications downloaded from the Internet and does not indicate any risk.

To proceed with installing and running the game:

1. Click on **More info**.
2. Then click **Run anyway**.

This will allow you to install and enjoy the game without any issues. Thank you for checking out my portfolio project!
