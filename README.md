# FallingBlocks
 My first Unity project from 2020. I lost the source code for this project when I switched computers, but managed to find a build in one of my cloud drives. This was one of my first experiences with game development from my college time. 

 It's a fun mini-game where you play as a blue rectangle, moving left and right with A and D respectively. The goal is to survive as many seconds as possible without getting hit by an assortment of falling blocks. Each block has a random rotation and position above the player. The velocity of the blocks is increased the longer you survive. The screen also wraps so the player can move infinitely one direction if that's your thing.
